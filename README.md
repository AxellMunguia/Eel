Eel is a spinoff of the classic video game Snake. In Eel, the player is welcomed with a title screen explaining the rules of the game, and the player presses space to continue to the map. This map is a grid that contains both the Eel and the fish. However, once the player begins the game with the 'WASD' keys, there is a frog, bomb, and coin that appear and disappear throughout gameplay. The goal of the player is to attain a high score, with the number being visible in the bottom left corner. When the player moves the snake, they are able to eat fish for one point, frogs for two points, and coins for five points without Eel growth. A bomb occasionally appears on the game board to trick the player. If the bomb is eaten, the game is over. The game can also end through wall collision or self collision as the Eel grows longer. In conclusion, Eel is a fun, interactive game that provides players with a new perspective on a classic game.
